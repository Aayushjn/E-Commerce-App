Mirror Directory Layout
-----------------------------------------------

Since version 2.3.2, Mirror uses a different directory structure of "mirror"
to support sample data for different build variants. Files originally
located in "mirror/" have been moved to "mirror/main/". Variant specific
directories will be created as necessary to store your variant specific
screen files (*.xml) for Mirror. Mirror handles these directories in
the same manner as how Gradle/Android Studio handles sourceset directories
(See below for more details).

If you do not use any flavor, build type or variant specific sourcesets,
you can find the screen files for all your layouts in "mirror/main".

Below is an example of the new directory structure:

    mirror/
        .res/                 <-- resources only for Mirror previews
        .gen/                 <-- files generated by Mirror, do not edit
        debug/                <-- screen files for layouts in "src/debug/res"
            build_type.xml
        free/                 <-- screen files for layouts in "src/free/res"
            variant.xml
        freeDebug/
            variant.xml
        main/                 <-- screen files for layouts in "src/main/res"
            activity_main.xml
            image.png
            sample.xml
        paid/
            image.png
            sample.xml
            variant.xml
        paidDebug/
            flavor.xml
            image.png
        paidRelease/
            image.png
        release/
            build_type.xml
            sample.xml

As mentioned, Mirror handles these directories the same way as how
Gradle/Android Studio handles sourceset directories. The screen files for layouts
in "main" and the selected variant (including flavours and build types) will be
merged before sending to the device.

For example, if the selected variant is paidRelease, then "paidRelease/image.png",
"release/build_type.xml", "release/sample.xml", "paid/variant.xml",
"main/activity_main.xml" will be pushed to the device.

If files with the same name exist in different directories, Mirror will send the
file in the most specific directory. Mirror assumes the same order as
Gradle/Android Studio (from the most specific to the least specific):

               variant > build type > flavor > main

We employ a simple way of merging the files in mirror screen directories:
Only directories related to the current selected flavor will be considered
and if files with the same name or relative path exist in different
directories, only the file in the more specific directory will be included,
the rest will be ignored.

Here's a more generalized directory structure:

    mirror/
        .res/
        .gen/
        main/
            <screen files with sample data>
            <files or directories you put here to help you structure your sample data>
        <flavor specific directories>
        <build type specific directories>
        <variant specific directories>
